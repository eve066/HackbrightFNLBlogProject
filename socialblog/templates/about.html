                    <p>This is Perla, a very friendly and always happy Cotton de Tulear. Perla means "jewel" in Spanish,
                        her
                        beautiful white coat and big eyes always puts a
                        smile on my face.</p>
                    <p>Perla is sweet and cuddly with a clownish personality and is always ready for a good time.
                        Cotons, as
                        they’re called for short, originated in Madagascar and are related to the Bichon Frise and the
                        Maltese.
                        They are loving, adaptable dogs who get along well with just about everybody. That includes kids
                        and
                        other
                        dogs! They can fit in with apartment dwellers or live in larger homes, so long as they aren’t
                        left alone for long hours of the day. These low-maintenance pooches can even thrive with novice
                        pet
                        parents
                        who are new to the dog world.</p>
                    <p>If you’re looking for a sweet, smart, playful addition to your family, you’d
                        have a hard
                        time finding a better breed!</p>
