        "content": "The connection between humans and dogs has been long acknowledged as one of the strongest bonds around - even if, at some point, they will inevitably try to steal a sausage off your plate. Here's why we think dogs are the best pets ever: 1) They’re incredibly loyal -  It’s no wonder a 40% of dog owners recently admitted they tell their dogs everything – we know we can trust them to be there for us! 2) Their positive attitude is infectious. Dogs get so excited over the simplest things – sticks, discarded food wrappers, a trip to the corner shop – that they make you appreciate the little things in life. No one can be sad with a waggy-tailed friend around. 3) They’re good at cuddles.Not much in life that beats a night on the sofa, snuggled up with a cup of tea in hand and your arm round a snoozing pooch.",

Sometimes, a dog can live with certain cats (depending on their age, temperament and activity level), but not others. Even if your dog has successfully lived with cats in the past, it is important to remember that each dog and each cat is an individual and therefore each introduction is different",

For example, a few years ago, research by Virginia Commonwealth University showed that people experience less stress when a dog is around. Researchers took saliva samples from factory employees and looked at how much of the stress hormone cortisol was in it. The results showed that only the employees who had had a cat or dog in their vicinity had low cortisol levels by the end of the day.",
